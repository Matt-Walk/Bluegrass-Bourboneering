#### Outline

---

In this repository you will find the following five (5) folders:

- Code
  - Contains the `Formula.py` file.
- Ignition
  - Contains the `HMI_Project_File.zip` and `HMI_Tags_File.json` files.
- PLC
  - Contains the `Ladder_Logic.RSS` and `PLC_Manual.pdf` files.
- Tables
  - Contains the `Table.xlsx` file.
- Report
  - Contains the `Final Design Report` file.

#### HMI

---

Below you can see an example the user interface for the HMI that we designed:

#### Formula

---

Below you can see how we derived the formula:

The first three steps show how volume can be modified into weight, which is one of the knowns of the algorithm.

Step four is an equation that was found to represent how the desired Alcohol by Volume (Proof/2) can be found mathematically, with a diluent. ABVf is the alcohol by volume desired, VB is the volume of bourbon, ABV0 is the out-of-barrel proof of the bourbon, VRO is the volume of the RO water to be added.

 In step five, the respective volumes are replaced by equation 3, with similar naming usage.  For this case, since weight is in lbs, g must be 32.2 ft/s^2, and the densities (ρ) are given in lbs/gal.

Steps 6-9 are algebraic manipulations to equation 5 that result in a RO water weight that can be added to the bourbon to reach the desired proof.
